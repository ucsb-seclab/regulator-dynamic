Modifications & future thoughts in a time-based log.



Tuesday, Aug 11th 2020 - Robert McLaughlin (<robert349@ucsb.edu>)
    * Make the GenerateChildren() function accept a CorpusEntry
      so it can take advantage of meta-state information fed back
      from the fuzzing execution.
    * Observed: another memory leak
        * Made V8RegExpResult a reference (not pointer) in ::Exec()

Monday, Aug 10th 2020 - Robert McLaughlin (<robert349@ucsb.edu>)
    * Add more documentation to coverage-tracker.hpp
    * Add final cursor position reporting to coverage-tracker.hpp
